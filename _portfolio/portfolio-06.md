<br/>
Utilized 2D images or 2D coordinates of the human body to estimate the real-world 3D coordinates of the key points of the human body, combined <strong><em>weak supervision</em></strong> with the <strong><em>well-performed GCN network</em></strong>. <br/>
Used the parameter of <strong><em>bone length</em></strong> to constrain the self supervision learning part in the weak supervision.
